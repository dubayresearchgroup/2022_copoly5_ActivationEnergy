Code to generate Figure S1 is in Jupyter Notebook file "copoly5_activation_energy.ipynb"

The Notebook file accesses .json files stored in the "/Flex" and "/Stiff" subdirectories
containing activation energy measurements from simulations with flexible and stiff chains 
respectively.

Activation energy calculations are performed via the "barrcalc_v5.py" python script and results
in the .json files discussed above. The python script utilizes trajectory and bond files from simulations,
which are not included due to space constraints, but are available from corresponding authors on request.
