Main text figures and SI figure S3-S8 from the publication (doi goes here) are generated from the Jupyter
Notebook 'Plotting_Results.ipynb'. Additional SI figures and calculations are available in the SIdata
subdirectory.

The subdirectory "alljarfile" contains pickle files with calculated variable of interest for each simulation
performed. These files are referenced in 'Plotting_Results.ipynb' for the creation of figures.

The subdirectory "bond_reader" contains analysis code used in the calculation of the variables stored in
the "alljarfile" directory, as well as an example simulation script and associated output files. The full
set of simulation data are not included due to size constraints, but are available from 
corresponding authors upon request.

The subdirectory 'LAMMPSsrc' contains modified source files for LAMMPS version 7Aug19, which are required to run
the simulations performed in this work.
