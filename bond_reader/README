The files "chainanalysis.py" and "polymerAB.py" are python3 code which contain the BondReader class
which are used to calculate quantities of interest from simulation output, including chain and block 
length distributions, degree of polymerization, reaction extent, dispersity, etc. 

The BondReader class operates on files output from simulation, and is used to produce the '.pickle' files 
stored in the '/alljarfile/' directory which is used to generate figures. 

An example simulation directory "220121_copoly_0.15epsAA_0.15epsAB_0.15epsBB_6.0rbAA_6.0rbBB_6.0rbAB_flex-1" is included,
which contains an example LAMMPS script and output files used by the BondReader class. An example of this usage is available
in the Jupyter Notebook 'ReactionBarrier_Analysis.ipynb'.

The full set of simulations used in this work are not included due to 
space constraints, but are available from corresponding authors on request.
