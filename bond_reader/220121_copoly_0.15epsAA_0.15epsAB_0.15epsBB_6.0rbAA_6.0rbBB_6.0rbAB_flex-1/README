An example simulation directory. Directory name indicates date simulation was run, the relevant LJ epsilon values, 
the values of the additional soft repulsions between bonding particles, the chain stiffness, and the simulation trial number.
All output files from the simulation follow this naming convention at the beginning of the filename.

The file 'run.lmp' is the LAMMPS input script for the simulation, and submit.sbatch is a SLURM submission script for simulations.
The initial data file 'mono7200.data' contains the initial system of monomers prior to equilibration. Such an initial data file can
be created via the 'mono_prep.py' python script.

All simulations were run in LAMMPS version 7Aug19. Some additional "in-house" LAMMPS src files were used, and are included in the 'LAMMPSsrc' directory.
